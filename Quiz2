Problem: Given a task to automate a monitoring tool to gather information on how a product is used at a customer environment. 
Users and super users are accessing a web-based product. We need to collect statistics such as: type of userâ€™s login more frequently, 
what time of the day is the product more used by a customer and most often visited pages and 
section of the pages visited (based on the clicks on the webpage) and capture errors & performance problem if any and report it back to SICK Inc.

Approach:
1.Assuming that this is a Web based product with a Web service REST API built on top of a database
2. We will send a request to the API using different payloads and will capture the response related to all the statistics that needs to be collected.
3.Capturing response from the API can be done in different ways
    1. Will create a POJO file and will pass this response to the POJO Objects using Gson and will get the related attribute values
   2.  Will use Jayway and get the related attribute values
   3.  Will use JSON objects and validate the response
4. Will pass all this information to a database table and generate the reports such as Compound report, Analytical report, Pie chart, Bar char
5. Create the counters and store it in the databases tables and the fetch the data using schemas to report it in the reporting tool.
